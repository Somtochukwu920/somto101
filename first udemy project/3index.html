					Boil the pasta: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1
					tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water). Once the water has
					reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered,
					stirring occasionally, about 9 to 11 minutes, until mostly cooked
					through but still a bit firm to the bite. Using a colander, drain and
					set to the side. Cook the ground beef: As the pasta cooks, heat a
					large skillet over medium heat and add the ground beef. Season with
					oregano, sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin. Cook,
					stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned and no longer pink,
					about 5 minutes. Add the butter and aromatics: Add the butter, onions,
					garlic, and tomato puree to the skillet with the ground beef. Stir
					until all ingredients are combined. Combine the pasta and ground beef:
					Add the cooked pasta to the beef mixture and stir to combine. Add the
					heavy whipping cream, chicken stock, parsley, basil, 1 1/2 cups of the
					shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and 1 cup of the shredded cheddar
					cheese. Stir until combined. Add to a casserole dish: Transfer to a
					9x13-inch casserole dish (no need to grease) and top with the
					remaining cheese. Bake: Bake the casserole for 15-20 minutes, until
					the cheese is browned and bubbly. Serve and store: For a looser
					casserole, serve right away. For a casserole that holds its shape a
					bit, let sit 10 minutes before serving. The casserole will keep,
					refrigerated in an airtight container, for 3-4 days. You can also
					freeze it by storing it in an airtight container for up to 3 months.
					To reheat, microwave or place in the oven at 350°F oven until it is
					heated through (this will depend on the portion size you are
					reheating).
